## What is Flovatar
Flovatar is pioneering a new way to unleash community creativity in Web3 by allowing users to be co-creators of their prized NFTs, instead of just being passive collectors. It offers an innovative platform for consumers to connect and build new experiences together. Unlike the first generation of NFT projects, Flovatar offers a low friction and gamified initial experience for the average consumer; its modular, composable and cross-generational foundation will allow it to expand easily across verticals (gaming, entertainment, metaverse).

Thanks also to our Flobits (NFT accessories that can be equipped to any Flovatar) and our pioneering innovations like interactive, animated and fully on-chain SVG graphics, we are already pushing the boundaries of what a NFT 2.0 can be.

## What makes Flovatar unique
There are many aspects that render Flovatar unique, but the main one is definitely that it enables users to express their individual personality by unleashing their creativity in selecting each trait of their avatar instead of passively receiving the results of a sterile randomization process, which happens on almost every other PFP project.

This makes our NFTs much more curated, artful and tasteful than any AI or algorithm could ever achieve. Instead of leaving it up to robotic chance, Flovatar opts for inspired choice.

The second biggest unique feature are the Flobits. They are separate NFTs that can equipped by any Flovatar and than can be freely traded as separate items. Thanks to the fact that, like Flovatar, they are fully on-chain SVG graphics, they can be animated, interactive and allow special combo actions to be made when equipped on the Flovatar (like a Flobit basketball combined with the Flobit basketball background that makes the ball become interactive).

We're trying to push the boundaries of what an NFT can be. We are firmly convinced that associating it to just a simple digital image is way too limiting and the possibilities to be explored are limitless. We want to be the pioneers that will lead by example by introducing more and more innovation into the space and show everyone what NFT and Web3 can really be.

Of course we had to face lots of challenges, especially to make the smart contract work the way we wanted and then to create the different SVG images so that they are able to interact with each other.

Inspiration came from the usual suspects (Cryptopunks, Cryptokitties, etc.) but while we like the PFP space, we want to become so much more than that.

## Why did you Build on Flow?

Because of the Cadence language that felt so much more appropriate for the Web3 space and also because of the a16z investment since I have great relationship with them thanks to Mayven Studios that built and manages their websites.

## What was your experience building with Cadence?
After some initial challenges in shifting the mental approach that is required to think of resources in terms of actual objects that can be moved around but not copied or duplicated, it started to become very natural and easy to learn Cadence. It definitely feels like a proper modern language specifically thought for the web3 space and that prevents anyone to shoot himself in the foot, unlike in many other blockchain programming languages.

The fresh start approach and all the playground tools along FCL and CLI definitely convinced us it is the right way to develop a web3 project and we couldn't be happier about our decision.

## How does your Web3 investment tie into your broad business strategy?
Our global business strategies are deeply intertwined with the Web3 space because of our nature, but we are looking into creating external collaborations with other big brands that want to join the space, while being innovative and engaging and not just "yet another image NFT." We're working very hard to develop both our internal story world and also a platform where other brands can take advantage of the same principles and apply them into their ecosystem.

Our goal is to have Flovatar plug into many metaverses, allow creators to use their Flovatars for commercial or other creative purposes, and to be able to have an asset that pays over lifetime royalties. 

Furthermore we will introduce the $DUST token that will fuel all the Flovatar economy and gradually migrate over a DAO structure.

* Pieland
* Find
* Graffle
* Emerald
* Some.place

## Investors
We're proud to be fully bootstrapped, but we're looking now into potential investors to help us speed up the innovation process and to build even stronger and more stable foundations for the future.

## Advice
Be creative and don't settle for what has already been done. Instead of copying ideas, the key of success is to bring something new to the table and push boundaries even further.

Deliver as much value as possible to the community members and people who purchase into the project. 

Provide regular updates on a release schedule, produce regular events, and provide opportunities & incentives for some of the most dedicated community members to promote and contribute to the growth of the project. 

Find other like-minded projects and leaders of other projects to do cross-promotions and collaborations that are a good win-win-win for all parties involved.

## The Team

**Luca Basile**:
*Creator and founder*

Had the original idea around March 2021 and started the smart contract coding in August after developing another, yet unreleased, NFT project on FLOW (webshot.world). 
Working in the web space as developer and technical director since early 2000's, he's now fully in love with smart contracts and became a self proclaimed web3 evangelist.

**Spencer Kelly**:
*Creative Director*

Worked with Luca 10-15 years ago first with the Travelclick company in Barcelona, and then they created a SaaS project called Workstack (workstack.io), still active today even though the codebase has remained the same since the last 8 years.

**Weilei Yu**:
*Strategic Advisor*

When we introduced the Flovatar project to him a few weeks ahead of the genesis drop, he immediately saw the potential and the innovation it was bringing into the space and offered to join the team as strategic advisor and provided invaluable insights and recommendations that allowed the Flovatar project to avoid common pitfalls and to achieve the success it has today.

**Jason Fleagle**:
*Marketing Director*


Jason joined the Flovatar team in March to lead the marketing initiatives and make the project grow even more. He has a background in computer programming, marketing, content marketing, digital marketing, and sales. He specializes in creating strategies and marketing plans to accomplish growth goals. He has helped generate $50mil+ for businesses in all industries the last 10+ years.

**Nate McGuire**:
*Business Advisor*

Nate is the co-founder of Mayven Studios where Luca has been working over the last 8 years as technical director. Mayven's clients portfolio include some of the top brands in the Bay area and he's been another great advisor to the project and provided lots of internal resources to develop the website and the ecosystem.

**James McCabe**:
*Story Doctor*

His vast experience in story building and narrative is allowing us to create a whole story world for Flovatar that has yet to be revealed. He and Kris Kato are helping to create truly trans-media experience where people will be able to access and enjoy the Flovatar world anywhere they are and with any type of media available.
