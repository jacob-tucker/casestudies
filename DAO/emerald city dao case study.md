## :dizzy: What is PROJECT NAME
Emerald City is the first DAO on Flow, founded in early November of 2021. We are doing a magnitude of things including educating the Flow ecosystem on Flow & Cadence development, developing tooling & products for DAOs/projects on Flow, and figuring out crucial (fair and inclusive) governance strategies for DAOs on Flow.


## :pencil2: What makes PROJECT NAME unique
**1. Educate the Flow ecosystem** 

This is unique simply because education on Flow is so rare, in fact mostly non-existant. Outside of my (Jacob's) YouTube channel, there are no Cadence educational resources to get people interested in the language. Thus, one of our goals at Emerald City is to educate developers and onboard people into the Flow ecosystem. We are doing that with our "Emerald Academy", which you can find here: https://academy.ecdao.org

**2. Build necessary tooling for DAOs/projects on Flow** 

We noticed that it is sometimes hard for project leads to run their communities optimally because the necessary tooling doesn't exist. For example, gating access to Discord channels based on on-chain assets. Thus our second goal is to build the tooling needed for these projects. 

I was inspired to form this DAO because I like to make things and be at the top. I noticed there were no educational resources, so I wanted to make them. There was little tooling for projects, so I wanted to make them. More importantly, my main goal out of all of this is to motivate community and find people opportunities in the space. We already have ~40 people who have learned Cadence through our DAO, and around 6 who have now taken on full-time developer positions because of it. And that makes me so happy.

In addition, because we are constantly building tooling, we have so many opportunities within the DAO to take our learners and put them onto real-world Flow projects almost immediately. We already know their experience levels and interest levels, so it's really easy for us to get people developing on projects they love, which benefits everybody. I truly believe we are making huge impacts on the Flow ecosystem.

## :ocean: Why did you Build on Flow?
To be honest, I have no honorable reason for doing so. I started in 2020, noticed I was early, liked the fact that I was early, and have just been addicted to it ever since. Love the people of course. I've made a lot of friends here, so maybe that's why.


## :wrench: What was your experience building with Cadence?
I love Cadence. Mostly because I'm really good at it. But I prefer it to languages like Solidity because it's **soooooooo** much more intuitive. Also so much easier to read which is important in the Web3 world when dealing with security & high-risk situations. Solidity is so complex, and the inheritance structure of it completely throws me for a loop. I also believe Cadence can serve as a much greater learning language to learn Smart Contracts than Solidity, because of its separation between transactions & contract layer.


## :globe_with_meridians: How does your Web3 investment tie into your broad business strategy?
Our primary goals are to build up the Flow community and provide projects with the tools necessary to building their products and communities, and moreso to just open the doors for more projects to get started on Flow. So, our business strategy is entrenched within Web3 already.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Key Metrics
The key metrics we are focused on are the following:
* Amount of people participating in our Emerald Academy bootcamps
* Developers working on tooling inside Emerald City
* Developers who have landed full-time positions in the space
* The amount of users actually using those tools in #4.

## :handshake: Core Collaborators in the Web3 Space
We collaborate with pretty much every single project and DAO on Flow at the moment. We do so to really get close to the community and ask folks what kinds of things they'd like to see built, and we get it done.


## :money_with_wings: Investors
No, we do not have any investors. In fact we aren't earning anything at the moment.


## :thought_balloon: Advice
Just do it!


## :busts_in_silhouette: The Team

**Jacob Tucker**:
*Founder*

I got started in the Flow ecosystem in the Summer of 2020 during the Open World Builder bootcamp. I've been developing on Flow ever since then, and naturally rose to one of the community leads in the space (because of my unbeatable skills and natural born charisma). I founded Emerald City DAO and take the lead on most projects within to help develop and guide contributors to where they need to be. [I also run this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6DzMRwj7SJ3nPrZqd5hHw) which I believe is the only up-to-date educational resource for Flow/Cadence developers.

**Bjartek**:
*Guild Leader*

Also started during the Summer of 2020, he's a Guild Leader at Emerald City, which are basically a bunch of administrators in the DAO. Bjartek founded the Versus Art and .find projects and is currently helping at NeoCollectibles as well. 

**Andrea Muttoni**:
*Guild Leader*

Core Flow contributor and a Guild Leader at Emerald City. Got started with Emerald City DAO about a month or so in and has been extremely beneficial to us not only on the development side but also onboarding and encouraging tons of developers to be interested in Emerald City, and more broadly, Flow.

**Bam**:
*Guild Leader*

One of the first members of the DAO, and a Guild Leader. Bam did not know Cadence or Flow at all, but through Emerald City, has learned how to develop on Flow and is now working on the .find team.
